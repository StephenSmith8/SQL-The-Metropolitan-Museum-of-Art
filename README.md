# SQL-The-Metropolitan-Museum-of-Art

Project Overview

In this project, I worked with a table named 'met' that contained a collection of American Decorative Arts from the Metropolitan Musuem of Art in New York city.

The table contained the following columns:

- id
- department
- category
- title
- artist
- date
- medium
- country

Listed below are the query prompts I was required to complete for this project:

1. Start by getting a feel for the met table. What are the column names?
2. How many pieces are in the American Decorative Art collection?
3. Celery was considered a luxurious snack in the Victorian era (around the 1800s). Wealthy families served stalks of it in intricate glass vases. Don’t believe it? Count the number of pieces where the category includes ‘celery’.
4. Find the title and medium of the oldest piece(s) in the collection.
5. Not every American decoration is from the Americas… where are they are coming from? Find the top 10 countries with the most pieces in the collection.
6. There are all kinds of American decorative art in the Met’s collection. Find the categories HAVING more than 100 pieces.
7. Lastly, let’s look at some bling! Count the number of pieces where the medium contains ‘gold’ or ‘silver’. And sort in descending order.

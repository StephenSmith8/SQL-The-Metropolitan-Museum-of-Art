1. Start by getting a feel for the met table. What are the column names?

 SELECT *
 FROM met
 LIMIT 10;

2. How many pieces are in the American Decorative Art collection?

SELECT department, COUNT(*)
FROM met
WHERE department = 'American Decorative Arts';

3. Celery was considered a luxurious snack in the Victorian era (around the 1800s). Wealthy families served stalks of it in intricate glass vases. Don’t believe it? Count the number of pieces where the category includes ‘celery’.

SELECT category, COUNT (*)
FROM met
WHERE category LIKE '%celery%';

4. Find the title and medium of the oldest piece(s) in the collection.

SELECT MIN(date), title, medium
FROM met;

5. Not every American decoration is from the Americas… where are they are coming from? Find the top 10 countries with the most pieces in the collection.

SELECT country, COUNT(*)
FROM met
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 10;

6. There are all kinds of American decorative art in the Met’s collection. Find the categories HAVING more than 100 pieces.

SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM met
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 100;


7. Lastly, let’s look at some bling! Count the number of pieces where the medium contains ‘gold’ or ‘silver’. And sort in descending order.

SELECT medium, COUNT(*)
FROM met
WHERE medium LIKE '%gold%'
OR medium LIKE '%silver%'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
